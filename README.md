<Pokedex_app>
-Description
Provides a list of all 151 first generation Pokémon.

To show the app cleanly and as neat as possible, Bootstrap was used. A modal was put in place to showcase each Pokémon’s attributes including the Pokémon’s weight, height, type, and abilities along with a pixel image of the Pokémon.

Bootstrap’s navigation bar was used due to its versatility on any sized screen. A bit of JQuery was also used alongside the JavaScript.

-App Challenges
The modal presented a bit of a challenge with bringing it up and managing the contents of the model box.

-Future Features
I’ll be working on a profile page for my contact information and I’m hoping to make the search engine useable. I would like to try adding preview images in the model buttons with an artist image of the Pokémon in the modal
